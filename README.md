# 🧠 Developer Notes by Bahri Uranlı

This repository contains my personal notes, summaries, and insights while learning and deepening my understanding of core programming concepts — especially in:

- **C Programming Language** (following the book *Effective C* by Robert C. Seacord)
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Essential Concepts**

These notes are a part of my continuous learning journey as a developer and are written with the intention of:
- Reinforcing my own understanding,
- Sharing knowledge with other learners,
- Building a public record of my progress.
